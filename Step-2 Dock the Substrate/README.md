1. Read Autodock Tutorial.pdf

2. 1.	Download Autodock4 (https://autodock.scripps.edu/download-autodock4/), Autodock Tools (https://ccsb.scripps.edu/mgltools/downloads/).
  
3. Prepare substrate:
   
   a. Optimize substrate using DFT. Save as pdb file using Gaussview (“sub.pdb”).

4. A useful tip for preparing the enzyme:
 
  a.	In AutoDockTools menu bar, “File → Read Molecule”, choose “3koh_combined.pdb”.

  b.	Delete water molecules: “Select → Select From String → type ‘HOH*’ in Residues → Add →       Dismiss”, then “Edit → Delete → Delete Selected Atoms → Continue”.
  
  c.	Add hydrogen: “Edit → Hydrogens → Add → Polar Only → OK”.

5. Follow the steps exactly as described in the Autodock Tutorial.pdf
