# AMBER_CYP2E1_3KOH

## Background
Classical MD simulation is a precious computational tool to investigate the process where no chemical reactions take place. It can be used for a wide range of scales, from small molecules (e.g., organic and organometallic compounds) to macromolecules (e.g., virus). In this tutorial, we will run MD simulation for the human cytochrome P450 E1 enzyme, which promotes C(sp3)–H functionalization reaction.
