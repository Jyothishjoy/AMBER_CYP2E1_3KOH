## Human Cytochrome P450 E1 enzyme (PDB ID: 3KOH)

**Background**

Classical MD simulation is a valuable computational tool for investigating processes where no chemical reactions occur. It can be applied across a wide range of scales, from small molecules (e.g., organic and organometallic compounds) to macromolecules (e.g., viruses). In this tutorial, we will perform MD simulations of the human cytochrome P450 E1 enzyme (`PDB ID: 3KOH`), which catalyzes C(sp3)–H functionalization reactions.
